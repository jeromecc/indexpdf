========

Index pdf with xmp metadata. Facilitate indexation by using OCR-ized text within pdf, in correlation with existing data.

##Use case

Many french primary care MDs work in solo practice or in understaffed group offices.
A large share of medical documents still arrive printed on paper through snail mail.
At the end of the working day, a typically huge pile of documents lay on the desk.
Documents are snap scanned and OCR-ized in batch.
Then, pdf files have to be read and linked to a unique patient, aiming for a zero identification error rate.
Pdf files are either included in or linked to an EMR, or simply archived in the file system inside folders (one folder per patient).
This application will try to considerably speed up the workflow and diminish risk of ID mismatch.
